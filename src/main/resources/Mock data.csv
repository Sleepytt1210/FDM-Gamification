Logical Relationships,Venn diagrams are a simple yet effective tool to visualise logical relationships between different groups of information. They clearly illustrate how items are similar or different. They have found their way into the business world helping Business Intelligence Consultants to solve and illustrate complex data relationships clearly and visually. At its most simple there are two overlapping circles where each circle can represent a set of items. The overlapping section shows what set A and set B have in common. The area outside the circles can be used to represent items which fall outside of the circles.,0,/images/challenge/1.png,BI

Positive and Negative Scenarios,A test scenario is a short definition of what is going to be specifically validated as part of a test. For example the Contact Us link on the homepage of the website takes you to the Contact Us page when clicked. When creating test scenarios you need to define both positive and negative scenarios for each piece of functionality. Positive test scenarios validate that functionality is working as expected when the user is using the functionality of the site in the way that we want them to. Negative test scenarios validate that functionality is working as expected when the user is using the functionality of the site in the way we do not want them to.,0,/images/challenge/4.png,ST

Testing Priorities,As part of their role testers must assign a level of priority to each test scenario they create. Priority indicates the order in which tests should be executed. Assigning priority is important as due to a range of factors outside the test teams control the number of tests to be executed may be reduced e.g. project timescales cut fewer testers available than initially expected etc. Therefore we need to execute the highest risk tests first when testing to ensure that critical functionality has been tested successfully.,0,/images/challenge/4.png,ST
